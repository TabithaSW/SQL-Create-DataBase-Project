    "- **Data modeling** is the process of conceptualizing and visualizing how data will be captured, stored, and used by an organization. The ultimate aim of data modeling is to establish clear data standards for your entire organization. \n",
    "- **Entity and Attributes:** The entities are the “things” in the business environment about which we want to store data e.g Products, Customers, Orders etc. Attributes provide a means of organizing and structuring data. E.g we need to store certain information about the products we sell, such as selling price or quantity available. These pieces of data are the attributes of the Product entity. Entities generally represent tables of database while attributes are columns of those tables.\n",
    "- **Relationship:** The relationship between entities describes how one entity is linked to another. In a data model, entities can be related as any of: one-to-one, many-to-one or many-to-many. This is said to be the cardinality of a given entity in relation to another.\n",
    "- **Intersection Entity(Reference Table):** In case of many-to-many relationship among entities, an intersection entity can be used to resolve it to many to one and one to many relationships. "
